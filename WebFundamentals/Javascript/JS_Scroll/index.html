    <h1>Random Number Game</h1>  
    
    <p>Random Chance
            Let's play the slots!
            
            Make a function that takes a number of quarters (1 quarter = 1 game).
            
            There is a 1 in 100 chance to win the slot machine (which will give you between 50 - 100 quarters -- use Math.random and Math.floor to pick a random number of coins).
            
            While the user still has quarters, use Math.random to determine if they won.
            
            If they ever win, return the number of quarters (ex: they had 50 remaining quarters and won 90, so it should return 140).
            
            Return 0 if all the quarters were wasted.
            
            Bonus (Only If You Have Time):
            
            Let the user pass the number they are willing to leave
            (ex: If they won the lottery and still have 40 coins, they will keep playing until they have collected 200 coins)</p>
